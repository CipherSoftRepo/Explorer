We are interested in creating a large-scale browser-based file system, functionally
similar to Dropbox’s web interface, or to a folder browsing structure you might find
on a Windows or macOS device. A user should be able to:
	- Create folders and subfolders
	- Create new files in the folders
	- Search files by its exact name within a parent folder or across all files
List the top 10 files that start with a search string.
Only “start with” logic is required.
	- Delete folders and files
	
For the purpose of this exercise, you can assume that a file is simply its name and
does not contain any other content.
API service should use a SQL or noSQL database ( of your choice!).
Provide a README with instructions on how to deploy your application.
